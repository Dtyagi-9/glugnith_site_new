Our GLUG is mainly designed to cater to the GNU/Linux related needs of the students, faculty, staff, and anybody else belonging to NIT Hamirpur. We are a heterogeneous mixture of people ranging from the beta testers and kernel hackers to the fresh-faced newbies, held together together by a common love for GNU/Linux in particular and Free Software in general.

!!! GLUG NITH is a moniker for the GNU/Linux User Group of National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur.
